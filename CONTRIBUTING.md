``# Contributing Guidelines – BDHB Lab

## Pair Work
- Labs are solved alone or in pairs (roles A & B).
- Rotate roles based on lab-level instructions:  
  - **Role A:** driver (typing, coding)  
  - **Role B:** navigator (reviewing, questioning)  

## Workflow
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b labX-solution`.
3. Commit changes with meaningful messages.
4. Open a Pull Request (PR) to merge into your team branch.
5. Tag your PR with `[labX]` in the title.

## Style Guide
- Python: [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
- Notebooks: keep outputs cleared before committing.
- Reports: PDF, ≤2 pages per assignment.
