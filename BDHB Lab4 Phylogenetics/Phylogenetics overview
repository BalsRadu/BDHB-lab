1.Intro to Phylogenetics
2.The anatomy of a Phylogenetic Tree
3.Tree building methods
    Distance-based methods
    Optimality-based methods
4.Models of sequence evolution
5.Phylogenetic confidence
6.Practical example: Building a phylogenetic tree to analyze evolutionary relationships.
7.Assignment and discussion
    Create and analyze a phylogenetic tree based on a custom theme, exploring evolutionary relationships in your dataset.
Instructions:

Theme Selection:

Choose a theme for your sequences (e.g., a group of related organisms, viral strains, or gene families).
Use bioinformatics databases to download relevant sequences.
Steps:

Create Your sequences.fasta: Save your selected sequences with clear identifiers.
Build and Visualize the Tree: Use the same approach as todayâ€™s practical, generating a Neighbor-Joining tree.
Interpret the Tree: Write a short paragraph explaining observed clusters in terms of evolutionary or functional similarity.
Deliverables:

Python script file with your code.
Tree visualization.
Interpretation paragraph.
