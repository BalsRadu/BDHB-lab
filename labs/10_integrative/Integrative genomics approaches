Introduction to Integrative Genomics:

Why integrate data? Address challenges of single-omics studies.
    Examples of horizontal (same type, multiple datasets) vs. vertical (different types of omics data) integration.
    Real-world applications: Disease subtyping, biomarker discovery, personalized medicine.

Gene Expression and Variant Data:
    Overview of gene expression profiling techniques
    Types of genetic variants (e.g., SNPs, indels) and their functional relevance.

Methods for Integration:
    Correlation-based integration (gene expression and variant co-analysis).
    Multi-omics network construction.
    Machine learning methods (e.g., matrix factorization, PCA for integration).

Case Study: Cancer Genomics
    How integrative genomics has advanced our understanding of cancer biology.
    Example: Combining RNA-Seq and SNP arrays for tumor subtype classification.
