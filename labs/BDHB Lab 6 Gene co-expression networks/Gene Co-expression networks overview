1.Introduction to Gene Co-Expression Networks:

Definition and importance of GCEs.
Biological relevance: uncovering relationships between genes in cancer research.
Comparison to clustering techniques.
Key Concepts in Network Construction:

2.Gene expression matrices and preprocessing steps.
Correlation methods (Pearson, Spearman, and Mutual Information).
Adjacency matrices and thresholding techniques.
Advanced Analysis Techniques:

3.Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA):
Soft Thresholding, Topological Overlap Matrix (TOM), and Hierarchical Clustering.
Challenges solved by WGCNA.
Graph-Based Community Detection Algorithms:
Louvain Algorithm and Spectral Clustering.
Visualization and Interpretation:

4.Tools: Cytoscape, Gephi, NetworkX, and Neo4j.
Biological interpretation through functional enrichment analysis (GO, KEGG).
Real-World Applications:

5.Insights into cancer biology (e.g., glioblastoma and breast cancer studies).
Translational applications in drug repurposing and target discovery.

6. Example: Construct, visualize, and interpret a gene co-expression network using breast cancer RNA-Seq data.
